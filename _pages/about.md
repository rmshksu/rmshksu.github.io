Welcome! My name is Robert Sholl, I'm a graduate researcher and instructor in the Department of Statistics at Kansas State University. I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D., working under Dr. Trevor Hefley, with my research focusing on modeling techniques for wildlife disease and other public health risks. Beyond my current quantitative career my background is in the biological and chemical sciences as well as a brief stint in real estate. 

Throughout this website, you'll find many of my academic resources including [Course Content](https://rmshksu.github.io/teaching/), [My Personal Blog](https://rmshksu.github.io/blog/), and much more. Scientific communication is my primary passion so I spend much of my free time developing new tools and resources for learners. 

If you're seeking to collaborate, please reach out! I'm always open to new challenges and ideas.
